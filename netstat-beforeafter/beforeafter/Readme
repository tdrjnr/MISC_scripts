I wanted to compare "netstat -s" data between "before" and "after".
For example, I usually do "netstat -s" before I run a benchmark, and
do it again after the benchmark.  I wanted to easily see how many 
packets were retransmitted during the run, for example.  

I was looking for such a script or program, but I could not find it.
So, I wrote one, and I call it "beforeafter" (Is there a better
name?).  

Here's an exmple: 

$ date > netstat.before 
$ netstat -s >> netstat.before 
$ cat netstat.before 

Wed Dec 24 09:26:59 PST 1997 
tcp: 
        43722938 packets sent 
                33228589 data packets (3645003285 bytes) 
                5161 data packets (23909373 bytes) retransmitted 
                10516156 ack-only packets (598441 delayed) 
        . . . . . . 

$ Run your benchmark/test here. 

$ date > netstat.after 
$ netstat -s >> netstat.after 
$ cat netstat.after 
 
Wed Dec 24 09:43:56 PST 1997 
tcp: 
        53377343 packets sent 
                40535998 data packets (1229324839 bytes) 
                5959 data packets (28516929 bytes) retransmitted 
                12865772 ack-only packets (765717 delayed) 
        . . . . . . 

$ beforeafter netstat.before netstat.after 

Wed Dec 0 0:17:4294967293 PST 0
tcp:
        9654405 packets sent
                7307409 data packets (1879288850 bytes)
                798 data packets (4607556 bytes) retransmitted
                2349616 ack-only packets (167276 delayed)
        . . . . . . 
 

You can tell time interval between "before" and "after" was about 17
minutes, and there were 798 retransmitted packets out of 9654405
packets sent.  Also notice that it calculated the "retransmitted
bytes" by assuming the netstat values were wrapped around at 2^32:

    before: 3645003285 bytes
    after:  1229324839 bytes

    (2^32 + 1229324839) - 3645003285 ==> 1879288850

This assumption is usually good.  However, for cases like # of
bytes, this might be wrong, especially for a long run.  During the
17-minute run, the byte counter might have wrapped around several
times, and probably did.

The "beforeafter" is a general purpose tool, and it should work for
other than netstat data.  It just subtracts the numbers in one file
from the corresponding numbers in another file.  Currently, it assumes
that all numbers are non-negative integers and they wrap around to 0
at 2^32.
